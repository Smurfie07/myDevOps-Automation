## Part 4: Setting up CI/CD Pipelines
●	Create two separate Git repositories for the server and client codebases, if not done already.
●	Set up CI/CD pipelines for both repositories to ensure the following:
●	Images are pushed to a public registry like Docker Hub.
●	Configure the corresponding VMs as private Git runners.
●	Update the image tag in Docker Compose, pull the new image, and deploy it as part of the CD process.
●	Integrate a Slack webhook (or another app of your choice) for deployment notifications.
